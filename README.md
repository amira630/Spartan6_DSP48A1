# Spartan6_DSP48A1
The Spartan-6 family offers a high ratio of DSP48A1 slices to logic, making it ideal for math- intensive applications. 
This is the design for the DSP48A1 slice of the spartan6 FPGAs.
The testbench for this design was challenging so directed test patterns were used whenever needed to verify the design and either
expected value to compare with in the testbench or check the result from the waveforms can be used to verify.
A do file is used to run the Questasim flow.
Vivado is used to go through the design flow running elaboration, synthesis, implementation for all
the designs making sure that there are no design check errors during the design flow.
